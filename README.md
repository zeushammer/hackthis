Ideas:
- bring game window to front on launch
- add error message for when commands not provided with argument (for commands that "require" an argument) [response to issue]
- add log-out command
- add disconnect command (disconnect from server)

To-do:
- write out sample-hack flow

Issues:
- during "boot" phase, user can press return and disrupt printing, causing text to become chopped up as it prints
- when a command is entered with no argument provided, interpret handles as command[-1], returning last character as "arg" 


Fixed issues:
